# MercadoPago Certificate Developer

Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is the project that I create to get the MercadoPago certification to be an accredited developer.

I built it from scratch using these technologies:

Backend: 
- Java 11
- Spring Boot 2.5
- Heroku hosting

Frontend:
- Angular 12
- Tailwind CSS
- Firebase hosting

The application is available here: https://mercadopago-dev.web.app
